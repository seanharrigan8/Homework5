This is a simple calendar application that allows users to schedule their work day. It's built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Displays the current date and time.
- Allows users to add events for each hour of the work day (9 AM to 5 PM).
- Saves events in the browser's localStorage, so they persist even after the page is refreshed.
- Colors each time block based on whether it's in the past, present, or future.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in your browser to start using the app.

## Development

To work on the project, open it in your favorite code editor. The main files are:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for handling user interactions and updating the page.
